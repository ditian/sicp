;Infinite runtime here. Again, (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause) is a self-defined function. To evaluate
;this function, firstly the interpreter must evaluate predicate, then-clause, else-clause, sequentially. Here
;predicate is (good-enough? guess x), then-clause is guess, both easy to evaluate; however, the else-clause is 
;again a recursive function without termination condition, so it never ends. As a matter of fact, the idea here is
;that we should only evaluate the predicate to decide what to do next.
